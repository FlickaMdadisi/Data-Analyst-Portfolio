# FlickaMdadisi **Data-Analyst-Portfolio**

## **About**

Hello! I am an aspiring data analyst and international development practitioner studying at American University. Currently, I am developing my technical and analytical proficiency using *R programming language.* The deliverables I produced as part of my graduate Data Analysis course demonstrate my ability to manipulate large quantitative data and generate high quality reports that communicate critical information.

To learn more, please refer to my [resume](https://github.com/FlickaMdadisi/Data-Analyst-Portfolio/blob/main/ResumeMC.pdf).

This repository serves to showcases my skills and share projects in Data Analytics. 

## **Portfolio Projects**
These two projects highlight my skills in **data cleaning and wrangling, data visualization, descriptive and inferential statistical analysis, and professionally presenting data driven research.** Both projects were created in R Markdown and contain clean reproducible code, raw data, and output. 

1. [**Slide-deck presentation:**](https://github.com/FlickaMdadisi/Slide_deck/tree/main) This project focused on visualization and descriptive analysis of the "Urban Social Disorder Data".

2. [**Poster presentation:**](https://github.com/FlickaMdadisi/Poster) This project involved conducting an empirical research, statistical analysis, and presenting findings in a poster. It includes hypothesis testing, data analysis, and data visualization of the "COSI Index Data".
